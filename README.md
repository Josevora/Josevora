### Hello World 👋 ###

Hi devs, 
My name is José Évora, I'm a self taught dev trying to learn new things...
I've made some changes to some Crypto Mining Algorithms like ETHASH and ETCHASH for private purpose...(they work! but I'm gonna keep them private 😜)
I've always worked alone, but now I'm building a team... that's my new adventure...
Since I'm working with a team now, I'm learning how to use Github in a ... professional way ... thus this Profile README! ;)

Stats are few, and grade is BAD, that will change pretty quickly 😏
